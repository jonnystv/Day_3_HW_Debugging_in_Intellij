# Java Debugging in IntelliJ

1. What is the purpose of a breakpoint?

A: A breakpoint will pause the code at the beginning of the line to which it has been assigned. This will allow you to stop and examine the code at that exact point in the application.

2. Does the line of code on a breakpoint run when you start debugging?

A: No, the breakpoint pauses the code at the bginning of the line.

3. How do we debug the next line of code?

A: The 'Step Over' button on the debug console menu will run the line of code and stop at the beginning of the next line, allowing you to start examining the code at that point.

4. What does the step into command do?

A: 'Step Into' allows you switch to the method being run and allow you to determine whether it is functioning as it should

5. What is the difference between evaluate expression and evaluate code fragment?

A: 'Evaluate Expression' allows you to run methods on the instances of the objects that have been created at that point in the code. 'Evaluate Fragment' allows you to run multiple methods, using temporary variables, to determine if the methods are functioning as they should.
